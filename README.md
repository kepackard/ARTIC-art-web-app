**STILL-LIFE WITH STRING AND DATA**:

A basic search engine using an API from the Art Institute of Chicago.

----------------------

Thanks for checking out my first web project! The required specs were:

* Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery
* Host the completed app on Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub
* Use AJAX to make a request to an external data source and insert the retrieved data into the DOM
* Frequently commit to github throughout the project
* Write a well-crafted README.md to describe your project.

- SCREENSHOTS HERE - 

-----------------------

**GETTING STARTED**

A user searches for any artist, title, or keyword in the search field. 

If more than one artwork is returned, only the first artwork is displayed.

-----------------------

**FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS**

In the future, I'll implement:

* Functionality to save a user's favorite artworks
* Description or trivia of the artwork
*
