**STILL-LIFE WITH STRING AND DATA**:

A basic search engine using [an API from the Art Institute of Chicago.](https://api.artic.edu/docs/) 

// I have a B.A. in History and previously worked at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, as a project manager. The MFA does not have a public API, but the Art Institute of Chicago has one! //

Technology allows viewers all over the world to enjoy fine art, up close and personally.

The Intitute's API runs their website, mobile app, and gallery interactives as well. Artwork images are NOT in the API however - images are served on [a separate API that is compliant with IIIF ('Triple-Eye Eff'; International Image Interoperability Framework)](https://iiif.io/). 

----------------------

**TECHNOLOGIES USED**

Thanks for checking out my first web project! The required specs were:

* Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery
* Host the completed app on Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages
* Use AJAX to make a request to an external data source and insert the retrieved data into the DOM
* Frequently commit to github throughout the project
* Write a well-crafted README.md to describe the project.

-----------------------

**GETTING STARTED**

A user searches for any artist, title, or keyword in the search field. 

If more than one artwork is returned, only the first artwork is displayed.

Give it a try [here.](https://relaxed-torvalds-66334f.netlify.app/?)

-----------------------

**FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS**

In the future, I'll implement:

* Mobile-responsive
* Functionality to allow a user to save his/her favorite artworks
* Short description or trivia of each artwork
* Return only artwork that is in the public domain
